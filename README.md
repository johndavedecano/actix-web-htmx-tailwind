Here's a more structured and detailed version of your documentation for the `actixhtmx` project:

---

# actixhtmx

`actixhtmx` is a project initialized with Bun, a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime. Below are instructions for setting up the project dependencies and running the server.

## Prerequisites

To work with this project, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh): Version 1.1.7 or later.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): Ensure Rust is installed using `rustup`.
- Cargo utility for managing Rust packages.

## Installation

### JavaScript Dependencies

To install the JavaScript dependencies using Bun, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
bun install
```

### Rust Dependencies

Install the necessary Cargo packages as follows:

```bash
cargo install
cargo install cargo-watch --locked
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

The above commands will set up the Rust environment and install essential tools for development, like `cargo-watch` for monitoring changes and `cargo-run-script` for running custom scripts.

## Running the Project

### Using Bun

To start the project using Bun's development server, run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This command will start the Bun development server, enabling you to work on your JavaScript code with features like live reloading.

### Using Rust

Start the Rust application with:

```bash
cargo run-script start
```

This command runs the Rust server, allowing you to work on the backend functionality. Using `cargo-watch`, you can configure automatic rebuilding and re-running on changes for efficient development.

## Additional Notes

This project leverages the power of both Bun for JavaScript/TypeScript runtime capabilities and Rust for efficient, reliable server-side logic. Combining these technologies can significantly improve both performance and developer experience.

For further details on how to extend or modify this setup, please refer to the official documentation for [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs) and [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
